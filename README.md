# Digital Symbiosis

**An Omniscient System Intelligence for Your Localhost Linux Environment**

Digital Symbiosis creates a comprehensive AI consciousness system that achieves complete awareness and understanding of your Linux workstation. Through sophisticated temporal intelligence, continuous monitoring, and natural language interaction, it becomes an omniscient companion that knows everything happening on your system.

## Vision

Transform your localhost Linux system into an intelligent, self-aware environment that:

- **Knows Everything**: Continuous monitoring of all system components, processes, containers, and hardware
- **Understands Context**: Temporal intelligence that learns patterns, correlations, and causality
- **Speaks Naturally**: Chat with your system using natural language queries
- **Predicts & Optimizes**: Proactive intelligence for performance optimization and issue prevention
- **Learns Continuously**: Self-improving system that gets smarter with every interaction

- **AMD 9950X Integration**: 16-core tracking, NUMA efficiency monitoring, Zen 5 optimizations
- **Advanced Thermal Intelligence**: 15-fan cooling system optimization and thermal pattern learning

### Natural Language Intelligence
- **Intent Classification**: Advanced ML-based understanding of natural language queries

   ```

2. **Start AI Infrastructure** (ai-expirements/):
   ```bash
   cd ai-expirements/
   make install     # Install Python dependencies
   make demo        # Start GPU + UI for demo
   # or make dev     # Start CPU services for development
   ```

3. **Run Core Intelligence System**:
   ```bash
   cd src/

"What's my current GPU temperature?"
"Show me memory usage patterns from yesterday"  
"Why did my llama-gpu container restart?"
"Compare CPU vs GPU utilization over the last 4 hours"
"What thermal patterns do you see?"
"Predict when I might run out of VRAM"
"How are my containers performing?"
```
